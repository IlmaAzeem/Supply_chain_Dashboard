# Supply_chain_Dashboard
I have created a Supply Chain Descriptive Analysis using python and Power-BI,where I have used several packages of python like Matplotlib,Pandas,Numpy,plotly which helped us in building analysis to determine the price of cars. I have tried to explain each and every command used,its significance and the result i.e. there outputs are also explained .
The Dashboard and my python source file are quite large in size because of which they are not able to diusplay data through pictorial representation.Please downlaod the file to have a better display of files
